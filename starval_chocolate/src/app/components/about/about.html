      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Satraval Chocolate began as a small family-owned chocolatier with a dream 
        to create the finest handcrafted chocolates. Today, we continue that tradition with the same 
        passion and dedication that started it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every chocolate we create is a testament to our commitment to quality, using only the finest 
        ingredients sourced from sustainable farms from South India.
